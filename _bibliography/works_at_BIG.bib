  Abstract={Recent emerging studies have unveiled the presence of millions of herbal small RNAs (sRNAs) in decoction of traditional medicines, suggesting their roles in cross-kingdom communication. Investigating the origins of herbal sRNAs, their delivery mechanisms, and modes of action in alleviating diseases could pave the way for innovative pharmaceutical engineering and novel clinical treatments.},
