   Abstract={The world of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) is ever-expanding, from small interfering RNA, microRNA and Piwi-interacting RNA to the recently emerging non-canonical sncRNAs derived from longer structured RNAs (for example, transfer, ribosomal, Y, small nucleolar, small nuclear and vault RNAs), showing distinct biogenesis and functional principles. Here we discuss recent tools for sncRNA identification, caveats in sncRNA expression analysis and emerging methods for direct sequencing of sncRNAs and systematic mapping of RNA modifications that are integral to their function.},

   Abstract={The human transcriptome contains many types of noncoding RNAs, which rival the number of protein-coding species. From long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are over 200 nucleotides long to piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of only 20 nucleotides, noncoding RNAs play important roles in regulating transcription, epigenetic modifications, translation, and cell signaling. Roles for noncoding RNAs in disease mechanisms are also being uncovered, and several species have been identified as potential drug targets. On May 11-14, 2021, the Keystone eSymposium "Noncoding RNAs: Biology and Applications" brought together researchers working in RNA biology, structure, and technologies to accelerate both the understanding of RNA basic biology and the translation of those findings into clinical applications.},

   Abstract={Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are among the most ancient small RNAs in all domains of life and are generated by the cleavage of tRNAs. Emerging studies have begun to reveal the versatile roles of tsRNAs in fundamental biological processes, including gene silencing, ribosome biogenesis, retrotransposition, and epigenetic inheritance, which are rooted in tsRNA sequence conservation, RNA modifications, and protein-binding abilities. We summarize the mechanisms of tsRNA biogenesis and the impact of RNA modifications, and propose how thinking of tsRNA functionality from an evolutionary perspective urges the expansion of tsRNA research into a wider spectrum, including cross-tissue/cross-species regulation and harnessing of the 'tsRNA code' for precision medicine.},

   Abstract={Although high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has greatly advanced small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) discovery, the currently widely used complementary DNA library construction protocol generates biased sequencing results. This is partially due to RNA modifications that interfere with adapter ligation and reverse transcription processes, which prevent the detection of sncRNAs bearing these modifications. Here, we present PANDORA-seq (panoramic RNA display by overcoming RNA modification aborted sequencing), employing a combinatorial enzymatic treatment to remove key RNA modifications that block adapter ligation and reverse transcription. PANDORA-seq identified abundant modified sncRNAs-mostly transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs)-that were previously undetected, exhibiting tissue-specific expression across mouse brain, liver, spleen and sperm, as well as cell-specific expression across embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cells. Using PANDORA-seq, we revealed unprecedented landscapes of microRNA, tsRNA and rsRNA dynamics during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, tsRNAs and rsRNAs that are downregulated during somatic cell reprogramming impact cellular translation in ESCs, suggesting a role in lineage differentiation.},

   Abstract={Precise biomarker development is a key step in disease management. However, most of the published biomarkers were derived from a relatively small number of samples with supervised approaches. Recent advances in unsupervised machine learning promise to leverage very large datasets for making better predictions of disease biomarkers. Denoising autoencoder (DA) is one of the unsupervised deep learning algorithms, which is a stochastic version of autoencoder techniques. The principle of DA is to force the hidden layer of autoencoder to capture more robust features by reconstructing a clean input from a corrupted one. Here, a DA model was applied to analyze integrated transcriptomic data from 13 published lung cancer studies, which consisted of 1916 human lung tissue samples. Using DA, we discovered a molecular signature composed of multiple genes for lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). In independent validation cohorts, the proposed molecular signature is proved to be an effective classifier for lung cancer histological subtypes. Also, this signature successfully predicts clinical outcome in lung ADC, which is independent of traditional prognostic factors. More importantly, this signature exhibits a superior prognostic power compared with the other published prognostic genes. Our study suggests that unsupervised learning is helpful for biomarker development in the era of precision medicine.},

   Abstract={One unmet challenge in lung cancer diagnosis is to accurately differentiate lung cancer from other lung diseases with similar clinical symptoms and radiological features, such as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). To identify reliable biomarkers for lung cancer screening, we leverage the recently discovered non-canonical small non-coding RNAs (i.e., tRNA-derived small RNAs [tsRNAs], rRNA-derived small RNAs [rsRNAs], and YRNA-derived small RNAs [ysRNAs]) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and develop a molecular signature composed of distinct ts/rs/ysRNAs (TRY-RNA). Our TRY-RNA signature precisely discriminates between control, lung cancer, and pulmonary TB subjects in both the discovery and validation cohorts and outperforms microRNA-based biomarkers, which bears the diagnostic potential for lung cancer screening.},

   Abstract={Background While significant advances have been made in uncovering the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at the genetic level, molecular events at the epigenetic level remain largely undefined. Emerging evidence indicates that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their associated RNA modifications are important regulators of complex physiological and pathological processes, including aging, stress responses, and epigenetic inheritance. However, whether small RNAs and their modifications are altered in dementia is not known. Methods We performed LC-MS/MS-based, high-throughput assays of small RNA modifications in post-mortem samples of the prefrontal lobe cortices of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control individuals. We noted that some of the AD patients has co-occurring vascular cognitive impairment-related pathology (VaD). Findings We report altered small RNA modifications in AD samples compared with normal controls. The 15-25-nucleotide (nt) RNA fraction of these samples was enriched for microRNAs, whereas the 30-40-nt RNA fraction was enriched for tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), and YRNA-derived small RNAs (ysRNAs). Interestingly, most of these altered RNA modifications were detected both in the AD and AD with co-occurring vascular dementia subjects. In addition, sequencing of small RNA in the 30-40-nt fraction from AD cortices revealed reductions in rsRNA-5S, tsRNA-Tyr, and tsRNA-Arg. Interpretation These data suggest that sncRNAs and their associated modifications are novel signals that may be linked to the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimer's disease.

   Abstract={The development of life beyond planet Earth is a long-standing quest of the human race, but whether normal mammalian embryonic development can occur in space is still unclear. Here, we show unequivocally that preimplantation mouse embryos can develop in space, but the rate of blastocyst formation and blastocyst quality are compromised. Additionally, the cells in the embryo contain severe DNA damage, while the genome of the blastocysts developed in space is globally hypomethylated with a unique set of differentially methylated regions. The developmental defects, DNA damage and epigenetic abnormalities can be largely mimicked by the treatment with ground-based low-dose radiation. However, the exposure to simulated microgravity alone does not cause major disruptions of embryonic development, indicating that radiation is the main cause for the developmental defects. This work advances the understanding of embryonic development in space and reveals long-term extreme low-dose radiation as a hazardous factor for mammalian reproduction.},

   Abstract={Mammalian sperm RNA is increasingly recognized as an additional source of paternal hereditary information beyond DNA.

Our understanding of the categories of sperm RNAs (such as tRNA-derived small RNAs, microRNAs, ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and associated RNA modifications is expanding and has begun to reveal the functional diversity and information capacity of these molecules. However, the coding mechanism endowed by sperm RNA structures and by RNA interactions with DNA and other epigenetic factors remains unknown. How sperm RNA-encoded information is decoded in early embryos to control offspring phenotypes also remains unclear. Complete deciphering of the 'sperm RNA code' with regard to metabolic control could move the field towards translational applications and precision medicine, and this may lead to prevention of intergenerational transmission of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility.},

   Abstract={In early mammalian embryos, it remains unclear how the first cell fate bias is initially triggered and amplified toward cell fate segregation. Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA, LincGET, is transiently and asymmetrically expressed in the nucleus of two- to four-cell mouse embryos. Overexpression of LincGET in one of the two-cell blastomeres biases its progeny predominantly toward the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. Mechanistically, LincGET physically binds to CARM1 and promotes the nuclear localization of CARM1, which can further increase the level of H3 methylation at Arginine 26 (H3R26me), activate ICM-specific gene expression, upregulate transposons, and increase global chromatin accessibility. Simultaneous overexpression of LincGET and depletion of Carm1 no longer biased embryonic fate, indicating that the effect of LincGET in directing ICM lineage depends on CARM1. Thus, our data identify LincGET as one of the earliest known lineage regulators to bias cell fate in mammalian 2-cell embryos.},

   Abstract={Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of regulatory RNAs. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of circRNA expression profiles across 11 tissues and four developmental stages in rats, along with cross-species analyses in humans and mice. Although the expression of circRNAs is positively correlated with that of cognate mRNAs, highly expressed genes tend to splice a larger fraction of circular transcripts. Moreover, circRNAs exhibit higher tissue specificity than cognate mRNAs. Intriguingly, while we observed a monotonic increase of circRNA abundance with age in the rat brain, we further discovered a dynamic, age-dependent pattern of circRNA expression in the testes that is characterized by a dramatic increase with advancing stages of sexual maturity and a decrease with aging. The age-sensitive testicular circRNAs are highly associated with spermatogenesis, independent of cognate mRNA expression. The tissue/age implications of circRNAs suggest that they present unique physiological functions rather than simply occurring as occasional by-products of gene transcription.},

   Abstract={Caffeine consumption has been widely used as a central nervous system stimulant. Epidemiological studies, however, have suggested that maternal caffeine exposure during pregnancy is associated with increased abnormalities, including decreased fertility, delayed conception, early spontaneous abortions, and low birth weight. The mechanisms underlying the negative outcomes of caffeine consumption, particularly during early pregnancy, remain unclear. In present study, we found that pregnant mice treated with moderate (5 mg/kg) or high (30 mg/kg) dosage of caffeine (intraperitoneally or orally) during preimplantation resulted in retention of early embryos in the oviduct, defective embryonic development, and impaired embryo implantation. Transferring normal blastocysts into the uteri of caffeine-treated pseudopregnant females also showed abnormal embryo implantation, thus indicating impaired uterine receptivity by caffeine administration. The remaining embryos that managed to implant after caffeine treatment also showed increased embryo resorption rate and abnormal development at mid-term stage, and decreased weight at birth. In addition to a dose-dependent effect, significant variations between individual mice under the same caffeine dosage were also observed, suggesting different sensitivities to caffeine, similar to that observed in human populations. Collectively, our data revealed that caffeine exposure during early pregnancy impaired oviductal embryo transport, embryonic development, and uterine receptivity, which are responsible for abnormal implantation and pregnancy loss. The study raises the concern of caffeine consumption during early stages of pregnancy.},

Instead of having prominent pre-patterning determinants as present in model organisms (worms, sea urchin, frog), we propose that the mammalian embryo takes advantage of more subtle cues such as compartmentalized intracellular reactions that generate micro-scale inhomogeneity, which is gradually amplified over several cellular generations to drive pattern formation while keeping developmental plasticity. It is therefore possible that by making use of compartmentalized information followed by its amplification, mammalian embryos would follow general principle of development found in other organisms in which the spatial cue is more robustly presented.},

   Abstract={High-throughput RNA-seq has revolutionized the process of small RNA (sRNA) discovery, leading to a rapid expansion of sRNA categories. In addition to the previously well-characterized sRNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), recent emerging studies have spotlighted on tRNA-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived sRNAs (rsRNAs) as new categories of sRNAs that bear versatile functions. Since existing software and pipelines for sRNA annotation are mostly focused on analyzing miRNAs or piRNAs, here we developed the sRNA annotation pipelineoptimized for rRNA- and tRNA-derived sRNAs (SPORTS1.0). SPORTS1.0 is optimized for analyzing tsRNAs and rsRNAs from sRNA-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical sRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs. Moreover, SPORTS1.0 can predict potential RNA modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within sRNAs. SPORTS1.0 is precompiled to annotate sRNAs for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users' input. For demonstration, by analyzing sRNA datasets using SPORTS1.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in tsRNAs and rsRNAs from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other sRNA species, tsRNAs bear the highest mismatch rate, which is consistent with their highly modified nature. SPORTS1.0 is an open-source software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.},

   Abstract={Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of novel RNAs with important biological functions, and aberrant expression of circRNAs has been implicated in human diseases. However, the feasibility of using blood circRNAs as disease biomarkers is largely unknown.\\ We explored the potential of using human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) circRNAs as marker molecules to diagnose active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).\\ First, we demonstrated that circRNAs are widely expressed in human PBMCs and that many are abundant enough to be detected. Second, we found that the magnitude of PBMC circRNAs in TB patients was higher than that in the paired healthy controls. Compared with host linear transcripts, the circRNAs within several pathways are disproportionately upregulated in active TB patients, including "Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction", "Chemokine signaling pathway", "Neurotrophin signaling pathway", and "Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells". Based on the differentially expressed circRNAs within these pathways, we developed a PBMC circRNA-based molecular signature differentiating active TB patients from healthy controls. We validated the classification power of the PBMC circRNA signature in an independent cohort with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at 0.946.\\ Our results suggest that PBMC circRNAs are potentially reliable marker molecules in TB diagnosis.},

   Abstract={Breast cancer amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) is involved in multiple biological processes, including pre-mRNA splicing. However, the physiological roles of BCAS2 are still largely unclear. Here we report that BCAS2 is specifically enriched in spermatogonia of mouse testes. Conditional disruption of Bcas2 in male germ cells impairs spermatogenesis and leads to male mouse infertility. Although the spermatogonia appear grossly normal, spermatocytes in meiosis prophase I and meiosis events (recombination and synapsis) are rarely observed in the BCAS2-depleted testis. In BCAS2 null testis, 245 genes are altered in alternative splicing forms; at least three spermatogenesis-related genes (Dazl, Ehmt2 and Hmga1) can be verified. In addition, disruption of Bcas2 results in a significant decrease of the full-length form and an increase of the short form (lacking exon 8) of DAZL protein. Altogether, our results suggest that BCAS2 regulates alternative splicing in spermatogonia and the transition to meiosis initiation, and male fertility.},

In a paternal mouse model given a high-fat diet (HFD), we showed that a subset of sperm transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), mainly from 5' transfer RNA halves and ranging in size from 30 to 34 nucleotides, exhibited changes in expression profiles and RNA modifications. Injection of sperm tsRNA fractions from HFD males into normal zygotes generated metabolic disorders in the F1 offspring and altered gene expression of metabolic pathways in early embryos and islets of F1 offspring, which was unrelated to DNA methylation at CpG-enriched regions. Hence, sperm tsRNAs represent a paternal epigenetic factor that may mediate intergenerational inheritance of diet-induced metabolic disorders.},

   Abstract={During mammalian pre-implantation embryo development, when the first asymmetry emerges and how it develops to direct distinct cell fates remain longstanding questions. Here, by analyzing single-blastomere transcriptome data from mouse and human pre-implantation embryos, we revealed that the initial blastomere-to-blastomere biases emerge as early as the first embryonic cleavage division, following a binomial distribution pattern. The subsequent zygotic transcriptional activation further elevated overall blastomere-to-blastomere biases during the two- to 16-cell embryo stages. The trends of transcriptional asymmetry fell into two distinct patterns: for some genes, the extent of asymmetry was minimized between blastomeres (monostable pattern), whereas other genes, including those known to be lineage specifiers, showed ever-increasing asymmetry between blastomeres (bistable pattern), supposedly controlled by negative or positive feedbacks. Moreover, our analysis supports a scenario in which opposing lineage specifiers within an early blastomere constantly compete with each other based on their relative ratio, forming an inclined 'lineage strength' that pushes the blastomere onto a predisposed, yet flexible, lineage track before morphological distinction.},

   Abstract={Multipotent skin-derived precursors (SKPs) are dermal stem cells with the capacity to reconstitute the dermis and other tissues, such as muscles and the nervous system. Thus, the easily available human SKPs (hSKPs) hold great promises in regenerative medicine. However, long-term expansion is difficult for hSKPs in vitro. We previously demonstrated that hSKPs senesced quickly under routine culture conditions. To identify the underlying mechanisms so as to find an effective way to expand hSKPs, time-dependent microarray analysis of gene expression in hSKPs during in vitro culture was performed. We found that the senescence of hSKPs had a unique gene expression pattern that differs from reported typical senescence. Subsequent investigation ruled out the role of DNA damage and classical p53 and p16(INK4a) signaling in hSKP senescence. Examination of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors revealed the involvement of p15(INK4b) and p27(KIP1). Further exploration about upstream signals indicated the contribution of Akt hypo-activity and FOXO3 to hSKP senescence. Forced activation of Akt and knockdown of FOXO3, p15(INK4b) and p27(KIP1) effectively inhibited hSKP senescence and promoted hSKP proliferation. The unique senescent phenotype of human dermal stem cells and the role of Akt-FOXO3-p27(KIP1)/p15(INK4b) signaling in regulating hSKP senescence provide novel insights into the senescence and self-renewal regulation of adult stem cells. The present study also points out a way to propagate hSKPs in vitro so as to fulfill their promises in regenerative medicine.},

   Abstract={Coordinated uterine-embryonic axis formation and decidual remodeling are hallmarks of mammalian post-implantation embryo development. Embryonic-uterine orientation is determined at initial implantation and synchronized with decidual development. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling these events remain elusive despite its discovery a long time ago. In the present study, we found that uterine-specific deletion of Rbpj, the nuclear transducer of Notch signaling, resulted in abnormal embryonic-uterine orientation and decidual patterning at post-implantation stages, leading to substantial embryo loss. We further revealed that prior to embryo attachment, Rbpj confers on-time uterine lumen shape transformation via physically interacting with uterine estrogen receptor (ERα) in a Notch pathway-independent manner, which is essential for the initial establishment of embryo orientation in alignment with uterine axis. While at post-implantation stages, Rbpj directly regulates the expression of uterine matrix metalloproteinase in a Notch pathway-dependent manner, which is required for normal post-implantation decidual remodeling. These results demonstrate that uterine Rbpj is essential for normal embryo development via instructing the initial embryonic-uterine orientation and ensuring normal decidual patterning in a stage-specific manner. Our data also substantiate the concept that normal mammalian embryonic-uterine orientation requires proper guidance from developmentally controlled uterine signaling.},

   Abstract={In rodent species, the ovary and the end of oviduct are encapsulated by a thin membrane called ovarian bursa. The biological functions of ovarian bursa remain unexplored despite its structural arrangement in facilitating oocytes transport into oviduct. In the present study, we observed a rapid fluid accumulation and reabsorption within the ovarian bursa after ovarian stimulation (PMSG-primed hCG injection), suggesting that the ovarian bursa might play an active role in regulating local fluid homeostasis around the timing of ovulation. We hypothesized that the aquaporin proteins, which are specialized channels for water transport, might be involved in this process. By screening the expression of aquaporin family members (Aqp1-9) in the ovarian tissue and isolated ovarian bursa (0, 1, 2 and 5 h after hCG injection), we found that AQP2 and AQP5 mRNA showed dynamic changes after hCG treatment, showing upregulation at 1-2 h followed by gradually decrease at 5 h, which is closely related with the intra-bursa fluid dynamics. Further immunofluorescence examinations of AQP2 and AQP5 in the ovarian bursa revealed that AQP2 is specifically localized in the outer layer (peritoneal side) while AQP5 localized in the inner layer (ovarian side) of the bursa, such cell type specific and spatial-temporal expressions of AQP2 and 5 support our hypothesis that they might be involved in efficient water transport through ovarian bursa under ovulation related hormonal regulation. The physiological significance of aquaporin-mediated water transport in the context of ovarian bursa still awaits further clarification.},
