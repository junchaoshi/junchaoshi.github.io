  Abstract={Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) play diverse roles in numerous biological processes. While the widely used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method has advanced sncRNA discovery, RNA modifications can interfere with the complementary DNA library construction process, preventing the discovery of highly modified sncRNAs including transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) that may have important functions in disease development. To address this technical obstacle, we recently developed a novel PANDORA-Seq (Panoramic RNA Display by Overcoming RNA Modification Aborted Sequencing) method to overcome RNA modification-elicited sequence interferences. To identify novel sncRNAs associated with atherosclerosis development, LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice were fed a low-cholesterol diet or high-cholesterol diet (HCD) for 9 weeks. Total RNAs isolated from the intima were subjected to PANDORA-Seq and traditional RNA-Seq. By overcoming RNA modification-elicited limitations, PANDORA-Seq unveiled an rsRNA/tsRNA-enriched sncRNA landscape in the atherosclerotic intima of LDLR−/− mice, which was strikingly different from that detected by traditional RNA-Seq. While microRNAs were the dominant sncRNAs detected by traditional RNA-Seq, PANDORA-Seq substantially increased the reads of rsRNAs and tsRNAs. PANDORA-Seq also detected 1,383 differentially expressed sncRNAs induced by HCD feeding, including 1,160 rsRNAs and 195 tsRNAs. One of HCD-induced intimal tsRNAs, tsRNA-Arg-CCG, may contribute to atherosclerosis development by regulating the proatherogenic gene expression in endothelial cells. Overall, PANDORA-Seq revealed a hidden rsRNA and tsRNA population associated with atherosclerosis development. These understudied tsRNAs and rsRNAs, which are much more abundant than microRNAs in the atherosclerotic intima of LDLR−/− mice, warrant further investigations.},

  Abstract={Exposure to ubiquitous plastic-associated endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is associated with the increased risk of many chronic diseases. For example, phthalate exposure is associated with cardiometabolic mortality in humans, with societal costs ∼ $39 billion/year or more. We recently demonstrated that several widely used plastic-associated EDCs increase cardiometabolic disease in appropriate mouse models. In addition to affecting adult health, parental exposure to EDCs has also been shown to cause metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes, in the offspring. While most studies have focused on the impact of maternal EDC exposure on the offspring’s health, little is known about the effects of paternal EDC exposure. In the current study, we investigated the adverse impact of paternal exposure to a ubiquitous but understudied phthalate, dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) on the metabolic health of F1 and F2 offspring in mice. Paternal DCHP exposure led to exacerbated insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling in F1 offspring without affecting diet-induced obesity. We previously showed that sperm small non-coding RNAs including tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) contribute to the intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic disorders. Using a novel PANDORA-seq, we revealed that DCHP exposure can lead to sperm tsRNA/rsRNA landscape changes that were undetected by traditional RNA-seq, which may contribute to DCHP-elicited adverse effects. Lastly, we found that paternal DCHP can also cause sex-specific transgenerational adverse effects in F2 offspring and elicited glucose intolerance in female F2 descendants. Our results suggest that exposure to endocrine disrupting phthalates may have intergenerational and transgenerational adverse effects on the metabolic health of their offspring. These findings increase our understanding of the etiology of chronic human diseases originating from chemical-elicited intergenerational and transgenerational effects.},

  Abstract={Although high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has greatly advanced small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) discovery, the currently widely used complementary DNA library construction protocol generates biased sequencing results. This is partially due to RNA modifications that interfere with adapter ligation and reverse transcription processes, which prevent the detection of sncRNAs bearing these modifications. Here, we present PANDORA-seq (panoramic RNA display by overcoming RNA modification aborted sequencing), employing a combinatorial enzymatic treatment to remove key RNA modifications that block adapter ligation and reverse transcription. PANDORA-seq identified abundant modified sncRNAs-mostly transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs)-that were previously undetected, exhibiting tissue-specific expression across mouse brain, liver, spleen and sperm, as well as cell-specific expression across embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cells. Using PANDORA-seq, we revealed unprecedented landscapes of microRNA, tsRNA and rsRNA dynamics during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, tsRNAs and rsRNAs that are downregulated during somatic cell reprogramming impact cellular translation in ESCs, suggesting a role in lineage differentiation.},

  Abstract={Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are among the most ancient small RNAs in all domains of life and are generated by the cleavage of tRNAs. Emerging studies have begun to reveal the versatile roles of tsRNAs in fundamental biological processes, including gene silencing, ribosome biogenesis, retrotransposition, and epigenetic inheritance, which are rooted in tsRNA sequence conservation, RNA modifications, and protein-binding abilities. We summarize the mechanisms of tsRNA biogenesis and the impact of RNA modifications, and propose how thinking of tsRNA functionality from an evolutionary perspective urges the expansion of tsRNA research into a wider spectrum, including cross-tissue/cross-species regulation and harnessing of the 'tsRNA code' for precision medicine.},

  Abstract={The human transcriptome contains many types of noncoding RNAs, which rival the number of protein-coding species. From long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are over 200 nucleotides long to piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) of only 20 nucleotides, noncoding RNAs play important roles in regulating transcription, epigenetic modifications, translation, and cell signaling. Roles for noncoding RNAs in disease mechanisms are also being uncovered, and several species have been identified as potential drug targets. On May 11-14, 2021, the Keystone eSymposium "Noncoding RNAs: Biology and Applications" brought together researchers working in RNA biology, structure, and technologies to accelerate both the understanding of RNA basic biology and the translation of those findings into clinical applications.},

  Abstract={The development of life beyond planet Earth is a long-standing quest of the human race, but whether normal mammalian embryonic development can occur in space is still unclear. Here, we show unequivocally that preimplantation mouse embryos can develop in space, but the rate of blastocyst formation and blastocyst quality are compromised. Additionally, the cells in the embryo contain severe DNA damage, while the genome of the blastocysts developed in space is globally hypomethylated with a unique set of differentially methylated regions. The developmental defects, DNA damage and epigenetic abnormalities can be largely mimicked by the treatment with ground-based low-dose radiation. However, the exposure to simulated microgravity alone does not cause major disruptions of embryonic development, indicating that radiation is the main cause for the developmental defects. This work advances the understanding of embryonic development in space and reveals long-term extreme low-dose radiation as a hazardous factor for mammalian reproduction.},

  Abstract={One unmet challenge in lung cancer diagnosis is to accurately differentiate lung cancer from other lung diseases with similar clinical symptoms and radiological features, such as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). To identify reliable biomarkers for lung cancer screening, we leverage the recently discovered non-canonical small non-coding RNAs (i.e., tRNA-derived small RNAs [tsRNAs], rRNA-derived small RNAs [rsRNAs], and YRNA-derived small RNAs [ysRNAs]) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and develop a molecular signature composed of distinct ts/rs/ysRNAs (TRY-RNA). Our TRY-RNA signature precisely discriminates between control, lung cancer, and pulmonary TB subjects in both the discovery and validation cohorts and outperforms microRNA-based biomarkers, which bears the diagnostic potential for lung cancer screening.},

  Abstract={Precise biomarker development is a key step in disease management. However, most of the published biomarkers were derived from a relatively small number of samples with supervised approaches. Recent advances in unsupervised machine learning promise to leverage very large datasets for making better predictions of disease biomarkers. Denoising autoencoder (DA) is one of the unsupervised deep learning algorithms, which is a stochastic version of autoencoder techniques. The principle of DA is to force the hidden layer of autoencoder to capture more robust features by reconstructing a clean input from a corrupted one. Here, a DA model was applied to analyze integrated transcriptomic data from 13 published lung cancer studies, which consisted of 1916 human lung tissue samples. Using DA, we discovered a molecular signature composed of multiple genes for lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). In independent validation cohorts, the proposed molecular signature is proved to be an effective classifier for lung cancer histological subtypes. Also, this signature successfully predicts clinical outcome in lung ADC, which is independent of traditional prognostic factors. More importantly, this signature exhibits a superior prognostic power compared with the other published prognostic genes. Our study suggests that unsupervised learning is helpful for biomarker development in the era of precision medicine.},

  Abstract={Background While significant advances have been made in uncovering the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias at the genetic level, molecular events at the epigenetic level remain largely undefined. Emerging evidence indicates that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their associated RNA modifications are important regulators of complex physiological and pathological processes, including aging, stress responses, and epigenetic inheritance. However, whether small RNAs and their modifications are altered in dementia is not known. Methods We performed LC-MS/MS-based, high-throughput assays of small RNA modifications in post-mortem samples of the prefrontal lobe cortices of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control individuals. We noted that some of the AD patients has co-occurring vascular cognitive impairment-related pathology (VaD). Findings We report altered small RNA modifications in AD samples compared with normal controls. The 15-25-nucleotide (nt) RNA fraction of these samples was enriched for microRNAs, whereas the 30-40-nt RNA fraction was enriched for tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), and YRNA-derived small RNAs (ysRNAs). Interestingly, most of these altered RNA modifications were detected both in the AD and AD with co-occurring vascular dementia subjects. In addition, sequencing of small RNA in the 30-40-nt fraction from AD cortices revealed reductions in rsRNA-5S, tsRNA-Tyr, and tsRNA-Arg. Interpretation These data suggest that sncRNAs and their associated modifications are novel signals that may be linked to the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimer's disease.},
