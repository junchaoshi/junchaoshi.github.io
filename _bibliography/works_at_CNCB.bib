  Abstract={Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent ovulatory and endocrine disorder affecting reproductive-aged women, yet the absence of a specific, rapid molecular diagnostic marker results in diagnostic delays and inaccuracies. Given the critical role of RNA modifications in disease pathology, this study utilized a high-throughput RNA modification profiling platform to investigate 15 types of peripheral blood RNA modification patterns in individuals with ovulatory disorders, including PCOS and Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), and control subjects. Our results revealed that distinct modification profiles correspond to specific disease states, with significant shifts in RNA modification inter-correlations observed across conditions. Additionally, specific RNA modifications were associated with clinical features, such as serum levels of testosterone and the follicle number per ovary (FNPO). To optimize diagnostic precision, we evaluated various machine learning models, identifying that combining m6A and m7G modifications in a light gradient boosting machine model achieves the highest accuracy in distinguishing PCOS, outperforming traditional diagnostic markers. This highlights the potential of RNA modification profiling as a novel, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for PCOS in clinical settings.},

  Abstract={Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) are a diverse group of RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and RNAs derived from structured RNAs like transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and others. These sncRNAs have varied termini and RNA modifications, which can interfere with adaptor ligation and reverse transcription during cDNA library construction, hindering detection of many types of sncRNAs by standard small RNA sequencing methods. To address this limitation, PANDORA-seq introduces a refined methodology. The procedure includes sequential enzymatic treatments of size-selected RNAs with T4PNK and AlkB, which effectively circumvent the challenges presented by the ligation-blocking termini and reverse transcription-blocking RNA modifications, followed by tailored small RNA library construction protocols and deep sequencing. The obtained datasets are analyzed with the SPORTS pipeline, which can comprehensively analyze various types of sncRNAs beyond the traditionally studied classes, to include those derived from various parental RNAs (e.g., from tRNA and rRNA), as well as output the locations on the parental RNA from which these sncRNAs are derived. The entire protocol takes ~7 days, depending on the sample size and sequencing turnaround time. PANDORA-seq provides a transformative tool to further our understanding of the expanding small RNA universe and to explore the uncharted functions of sncRNAs.},

  Abstract={Post-transcriptional mechanisms are fundamental safeguards of progenitor cell identity and are often dysregulated in cancer. Here, we identified regulators of P-bodies as crucial vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) through genome-wide CRISPR screens in normal and malignant haematopoietic progenitors. We found that leukaemia cells harbour aberrantly elevated numbers of P-bodies and show that P-body assembly is crucial for initiation and maintenance of AML. Notably, P-body loss had little effect upon homoeostatic haematopoiesis but impacted regenerative haematopoiesis. Molecular characterization of P-bodies purified from human AML cells unveiled their critical role in sequestering messenger RNAs encoding potent tumour suppressors from the translational machinery. P-body dissolution promoted translation of these mRNAs, which in turn rewired gene expression and chromatin architecture in leukaemia cells. Collectively, our findings highlight the contrasting and unique roles of RNA sequestration in P-bodies during tissue homoeostasis and oncogenesis. These insights open potential avenues for understanding myeloid leukaemia and future therapeutic interventions.},

  Abstract={Emerging studies suggest that various parental exposures affect offspring cardiovascular health, yet the specific mechanisms, particularly the influence of paternal cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors on offspring cardiovascular health, remain elusive. The present study explores how paternal hypercholesterolemia affects offspring atherosclerosis development using the LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) mouse model. We found that paternal high-cholesterol diet feeding led to significantly increased atherosclerosis in F1 female, but not male, LDLR-/- offspring. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted that paternal hypercholesterolemia stimulated proatherogenic genes, including Ccn1 and Ccn2, in the intima of female offspring. Sperm small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), particularly transfer RNA-derived (tRNA-derived) small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), contribute to the intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic phenotypes. Using a newly developed PANDORA-Seq method, we identified that high-cholesterol feeding elicited changes in sperm tsRNA/rsRNA profiles that were undetectable by traditional RNA-Seq, and these altered sperm sncRNAs were potentially key factors mediating paternal hypercholesterolemia-elicited atherogenesis in offspring. Interestingly, high-cholesterol feeding altered sncRNA biogenesis-related gene expression in the epididymis but not testis of LDLR-/- sires; this may have led to the modified sperm sncRNA landscape. Our results underscore the sex-specific intergenerational effect of paternal hypercholesterolemia on offspring cardiovascular health and contribute to the understanding of chronic disease etiology originating from parental exposures.},

  Abstract={Background: Metabolic homeostasis is closely related to early impairment of cell fate determination and embryo development. The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cellular metabolism in the body. Inhibition of mTOR signaling in early embryo causes postimplantation development failure, yet the mechanisms are still poorly understood. Methods: Pregnancy mice and preimplantation mouse embryo were treated with mTOR inhibitor in vivo and in vitro respectively, and subsequently examined the blastocyst formation, implantation, and post-implantation development. We used immunofluorescence staining, RNA-Seq smart2, and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing technologies to investigate the impact of mTOR inhibitors on the quality, cell fate determination, and molecular alterations in developing embryos. Results: We showed mTOR suppression during preimplantation decreases the rate of blastocyst formation and the competency of implantation, impairs the post implantation embryonic development. We discovered that blocking mTOR signaling negatively affected the transformation of 8-cell embryos into blastocysts and caused various deficiencies in blastocyst quality. These included problems with compromised trophectoderm cell differentiation, as well as disruptions in cell fate specification. mTOR suppression significantly affected the transcription and DNA methylation of embryos. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors increase lysosomal activation and disrupts the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in blastocysts.},

  Abstract={Background: Gene-environment interactions contribute to metabolic disorders such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. In addition to affecting metabolic homeostasis directly, drugs and environmental chemicals can cause persistent alterations in metabolic portfolios across generations in a sex-specific manner. Here, we use inorganic arsenic (iAs) as a prototype drug and chemical to dissect such sex differences. Methods: After weaning, C57BL/6 WT male mice were treated with 250 ppb iAs in drinking water (iAsF0) or normal water (conF0) for 6 weeks and then bred with 15-week-old, non-exposed females for 3 days in cages with only normal water (without iAs), to generate iAsF1 or conF1 mice, respectively. F0 females and all F1 mice drank normal water without iAs all the time. Results: We find that exposure of male mice to 250 ppb iAs leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in F1 female offspring (iAsF1-F), with almost no change in blood lipid profiles. In contrast, F1 males (iAsF1-M) show lower liver and blood triglyceride levels than non-exposed control, with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The liver of F1 offspring shows sex-specific transcriptomic changes, with hepatocyte-autonomous alternations of metabolic fluxes in line with the sex-specific phenotypes. The iAsF1-F mice show altered levels of circulating estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone. Ovariectomy or liver-specific knockout of estrogen receptor α/β made F1 females resemble F1 males in their metabolic responses to paternal iAs exposure. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that disrupted reproductive hormone secretion in alliance with hepatic estrogen signaling accounts for the sex-specific intergenerational effects of paternal iAs exposure, which shed light on the sex disparities in long-term gene-environment interactions.},
