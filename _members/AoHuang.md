I graduated from Northwest A&F University in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree under the guidance of Dr. Shi. Throughout my bachelor's degree, I primarily focused on gaining a strong foundation in mathematics, comprehending the fundamentals of the information field, and utilizing computers as tools to address practical problems. My research interests are centered in the field of bioinformatics, and I possess a strong interest and proficiency in programming.
