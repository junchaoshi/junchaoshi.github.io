I graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2022 with a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics. My graduation project focused on computational biochemistry. Due to my passion for genomics and my keen interest in data mining and analysis, I am currently pursuing a master's degree under the guidance of Dr. Shi.
