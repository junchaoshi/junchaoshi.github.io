I graduated from Harbin Medical University in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in bioinformatics. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Shi. Throughout my bachelor’s degree, I primarily focused on data analysis and regulatory network construction. My research interests lie in combining data analysis with experiments to explore the potential function of small RNAs in key biological processes.
