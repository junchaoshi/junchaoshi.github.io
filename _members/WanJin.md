I graduated from Shandong University in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Science. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree under the guidance of Dr. Shi. My initiation into lab research commenced in my freshman year, offering me invaluable experiences ranging from pharmacy, marine biology to bioinformatics, CADD (Computer Aided Drug Design), and related experimental validation. My research interests lie in the field of epigenetics and bioinformatics. Additionally, I possess a strong interest and proficiency in molecular and cellular biology experiment.
