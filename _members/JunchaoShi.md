I am a incoming researcher at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I delve into the intricacies of small RNAs and their modifications, exploring their impact on normal and disease conditions as well as their potential diagnostic and prognostic value for precision medicine. My research focus is primarily centered on the systematic discovery of `non-canonical small RNA`, including tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs).
With a foundation in bioinformatics and developmental biology, I am driven to expand our understanding of life processes from an evolutionary perspective. I am also actively engaged in improvement of RNA sequencing technology and design software for the analysis of small RNA expression, structure, and function.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics, Genomics & Bioinformatics at University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Dr. Qi Chen](http://qichen-lab.info/) and [Dr. Tong Zhou](https://tongzhoulab.org/). I also received my M.S. (summa cum laude) in Developmental Biology at University of Chinese academy of Sciences, China, and my B.S. (summa cum laude) in Biotechnology (animal) at Jilin University, China. \[[CV](/cv/)\]
