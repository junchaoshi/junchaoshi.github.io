I graduated from Nanjing Agricultural University in 2023 with a Master's degree in Genetics. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. under the guidance of Dr. Shi. Throughout my Master's degree, my primary focus was on developing sRNA analysis tools and constructing sRNA-related databases. My research interests lie in the field of data mining and methodology. Additionally, I possess a strong interest and proficiency in coding.
