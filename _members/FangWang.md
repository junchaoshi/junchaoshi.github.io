I am an Assistant Researcher at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science degree from Shihezi University in July 2014. Subsequently, I pursued a Master's Degree in Developmental Biology at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, graduating in July 2017. In December 2020, I completed my doctoral studies in Developmental Physiology at the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) in France. Following the attainment of my Ph.D., I continued my research endeavors as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Germany. My research is centered on unraveling the mysteries of epigenetic modifications and their pivotal role in shaping the destiny of mouse oocytes and early embryos. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the broader understanding of the fundamental processes governing life's earliest stages.
